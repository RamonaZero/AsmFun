# AsmFun
x86_64 Assembly Projects for fun

# Development Environment
- OS: OpenBSD (No Xorg!)
- Architecture: x86_64 - AMD64
- Editor: Emacs
- Assembler: nasm
- Linker: clang
- Debugger: gdb (intel syntax enabled)

# Notes
I have no idea how to do breakpoints in code D: so I use the "undocumented" icebp opcode to stop at points.
If there's a better way, let me know =_=

# TODO
- Combine all of them into a single program. switching to each "test" via flag (?) (I am lazy so maybe not. xP)
